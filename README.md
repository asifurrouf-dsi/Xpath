## Xpath Notes

Selenium test automation engineers must be comfortable in locating elements in web pages effectively. XPath and CSS are very powerful location strategies used in Selenium as compared to other location strategies (id, name, linkText, partialLinkText and tagName )
Mastering XPath or CSS is essential for the Selenium test automation engineers to locate dynamic web elements and elements without id or name. Tagname is not a useful location strategy to locate elements as there are many elements with the same tagname. LinkText 
is only useful for the <a> tags only. Also, it is not useful when the visible text changes as in multilingual systems.
